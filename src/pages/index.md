# hello

This is my personal website which includes a portfolio page, tutorials, my blog, and reference documentation I keep up for various technologies I use (similar to a personal [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) site).

The wiki covers parts technologies that I like using and want my own reference documentation for. I am looking to cover some of the following topics in the near future:

- [ ] Python
- [ ] Django
- [ ] Sass
- [ ] Bootstrap

As I begin to populate the site, I hope to include tutorials for processes I want to document for myself and others, such as my expereince setting up this very website with Docusaurus!

This site also contains my freshly created blog, which will include articles that I want to create. Feel free to read them.

This site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator built on top of [React](https://react.dev/). If you find yourself in the same boat as me, already knowing a bit of React and wanting to create a Wiki site, I can recommend it.
