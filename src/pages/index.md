# hello

This is my personal website which includes a portfolio page, tutorials, my blog, and reference documentation I keep up for various technologies I use (similar to a personal [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) site).

The wiki covers parts technologies that I like using and want my own reference documentation for. Expect content on:

- [ ] Python
- [ ] Django
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Various web-related topics

As I begin to populate the site, I hope to include tutorials for processes I want to document for myself and others, such as my expereince setting up this very website with Docusaurus!

This site also contains my mostly inactive blog which will include posts when I feel like writing them.

This site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator built on top of [React](https://react.dev/). If you find yourself in the same boat as me, already knowing a bit of React and wanting to create a wiki site, I can recommend it. 
If you just want a simple wiki for your notes, I would recommend [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/). Both these options can be hosted for free on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
