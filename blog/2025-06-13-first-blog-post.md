Hello, this is the very first blog post on this said made by me!

I hope you have enjoyed looking around, even though if you are reading this it means that I have too little actual content on this site yet to warrant taking down this test post. I hope you are doing well and excited for updates, which will be coming soon!

<!-- truncate -->

For those curious, this post is made using markdown syntax. The next post will be made using MDX, which is basically markdown with support for React components. maybe that post will actaully be a real one!

Have a good day, bye!
